    <h1>Time and Space Complexity in Algorithms</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measurement of how an algorithm's execution time increases as the input size grows. It helps developers identify the most efficient algorithm for a specific task. When analyzing Time complexity, we focus on the worst-case scenario, which represents the maximum number of operations required for an input of size n. Efficient algorithms often have better time complexity, such as O(1), O(log n), or O(n), compared to less efficient ones with O(nÂ²) or higher.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to its input size. Unlike time complexity which analyzes execution time, Space Complexity focuses on memory usage. The O(n) notation in Space Complexity indicates that memory usage grows linearly with input size, meaning if the input size doubles, the memory requirement approximately doubles as well.</p>
