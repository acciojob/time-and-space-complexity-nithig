	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity efficient is a way to describe how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. Understanding time complexity helps you select the most efficient algorithms for specific tasks and predict how they'll perform with larger datasets.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> O(n) measures how much memory an algorithm uses relative to its input size. When we say an algorithm has O(n) space complexity, it means the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.</p>
